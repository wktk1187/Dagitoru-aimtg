/**
 * Implements a global exclusive lock using the Navigator LockManager API. It
 * is available on all browsers released after 2022-03-15 with Safari being the
 * last one to release support. If the API is not available, this function will
 * throw. Make sure you check availablility before configuring {@link
 * GoTrueClient}.
 *
 * You can turn on debugging by setting the `supabase.gotrue-js.locks.debug`
 * local storage item to `true`.
 *
 * Internals:
 *
 * Since the LockManager API does not preserve stack traces for the async
 * function passed in the `request` method, a trick is used where acquiring the
 * lock releases a previously started promise to run the operation in the `fn`
 * function. The lock waits for that promise to finish (with or without error),
 * while the function will finally wait for the result anyway.
 *
 * @param name Name of the lock to be acquired.
 * @param acquireTimeout If negative, no timeout. If 0 an error is thrown if
 *                       the lock can't be acquired without waiting. If positive, the lock acquire
 *                       will time out after so many milliseconds. An error is
 *                       a timeout if it has `isAcquireTimeout` set to true.
 * @param fn The operation to run once the lock is acquired.
